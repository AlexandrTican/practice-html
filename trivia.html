            <strong> Another Arc-Drive (AAD) </strong>
                <div>
         41236C in BLOOD HEAT will activate another, usually stronger, version of the Arc-Drive. 
         Using it will deplete all your remaining Magic Circuit.

            <strong>Blockstring</strong>
                <div>

                </div>
            <strong>Bunker</strong>
                <div>
                Inputting 214D with any moon characters. When used during guarding/blocking, your character will attempt to clash the oncoming opponent's attack and follow up with a unique bunker attack.
                For half moon characters, this attack has invincibility frames, knocks down without dealing damage, and costs 100% meter. For other moon characters, this attack deals damage and costs 50% meter.
        <div>
When done outside blocking, the characters does a quick EX shield and then follows up with the damaging version of the bunker (even if you are using half moon style). This does not cost any meter, but degrades guard bar. Has a clash frame on startup.

                    Melty Blood players universally refer to what's understood as "numpad notation". 
                Numpad notation is a convenient sort of "coding" to describe character actions in-game. 
                It makes moves simple to reference, it helps to visualize/convey combo transcripts, and it even transcends language barriers. 
                        Due to the universal, undeniable efficiency of this notation, knowing how to utilize it will be key to your improvement.

                <div>NOTE: Numpad Notation is always under the assumption your character is on the left, facing right, no matter what. NEVER the opposite.
                    ...
                    </div>
                    <!-- insert stuff about inputs, as table or etc-->
                    <div>
                            This is the directional aspect of numpad notation. Next we'll be talking about the buttons.
    In Melty Blood, you have four main buttons: A, B, C, and D. A is your Light Attack, B is your Medium Attack, and C is your Strong Attack. 
    D is your Shield, but it also has different uses based on what directionals you input. So 2B = Crouching Medium Attack,
    and that 5C = Standing Strong Attack, Please note that jumping attacks are not notated with 7, 8, or 9, but with j. 
          So a Jumping Light Attack would be j.A. 
    Directionals may occasionally play a part in jumping notation, if absolutely mandatory to include,  but are usually not for the sake of compression. 
        Provided what you've learned, you should now know that 236A = a quarter-circle forward Special Move's Light Attack variant. 
          And that j.22B is a jumping down-down Special Move's Medium Attack variant.
    And with that, you now understand how to conveniently read and write your own Normal and Special Moves!

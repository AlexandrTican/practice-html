        <li>What is Melty Blood Actress Again: Current Code?</li>
        <dl>
            Melty Blood Actress Again: Current Code (commonly abbreviated to MBAACC or just MB) is the newest version of the originally doujin fighter Melty Blood. The series originated as a spinoff fighting game/visual novel hybrid spinoff of Type-Moon's Tsukihime series.
            Over the years as its popularity rose, the focus on story was lost and the game mechanics were reworked drastically, 
            eventually receiving a release in arcades as Act Cadenza in 2005. After several revisions,
            a sequel (Actress Again) was released in Arcades in 2008, and a new revision, Current Code, was released in 2010, reaching homes with a v1.07 edition PC port at the turn of 2012.

            Melty Blood's gameplay is arguably one of the richest to this day in anime fighting games. There are 31 characters, each with 3 Moon Styles. On top of the differences in mechanics from Moon Styles mechanics alone, all characters also get changes to specials and normals. Some even go as far as differing in movement options and/or HP. 
        Taken into account, the roster expands to 93 distinct characters, which all play differently from one other. There's no way you're not going to find at least one character+moon that suits your playstyle, tastes, or which at least "vibes" with you. 
        As for gameplay, there's tons of different ways to interpret and structure your gameplan thanks to system mechanics like Reverse Beat. You could spend hours in training mode exploring Reverse Beat alone. And speaking of training mode, Melty sports one of the best in the business not only at the time of its release, but at present too thanks to enhancements from the community edition of the game.

            If competitive play isn't your speed and you're looking for a more easygoing time, the game's soundtrack is universally agreed to be highly enjoyable, with seldom any song in the entire OST that's a turnoff. The game's aesthetic has also aged wonderfully, with some of the clearest and smoothest animated sprites in the genre; taking inspiration from Street Fighter III. 
            This isn't even to mention that the game is packed with an arcade mode, a story mode, replay mode, and much, much more.

            So whether you're a simple Tsukihime fan, interested in a new fighting game, looking for something they can occasionally open at random to kill time, or a competitive player hunting for a deep title to try, 
            Melty Blood is the perfect choice. Once its incredible movement feel, boundless depth, immaculate presentation, and friendliness to modern or low spec devices come to your fingertips for free, you'll understand why it's widely hailed as the poverty game.
            If you're on the fence for trying out Melty Blood, you might as well give it a shot. At worst you lose some time, and come to the conclusion it's not for you. At best, who knows? With all the high quality content on offer, the sky is the limit.

            Like most fighting games, the execution requirement varies greatly depending on the character chosen. 
Melty Blood is designed from the ground-up to be very user-friendly however, and the execution level is something that any modern fighting game player would feel comfortable with. Players coming from slower Capcom-style games may find concepts like instant airdashing strange and unusual,
            but the difficulty is no greater than most advanced tricks in games such as SF4 or MVC3.

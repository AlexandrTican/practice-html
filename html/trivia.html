                <h1>Standard Terms and Abbreviations</h1>
            <strong>Blockstring</strong>
                <div>
                Strings (usually airtight) of attacks that get blocked.
                </div>
            <strong>Bunker</strong>
                    <div>
                Inputting 214D with any moon characters. When used during guarding/blocking, 
                            your character will attempt to clash the oncoming opponent's attack and follow up with a unique bunker attack.
                For half moon characters, this attack has invincibility frames, knocks down without dealing damage, 
                            and costs 100% meter. For other moon characters, this attack deals damage and costs 50% meter.
<div>
When done outside blocking, the characters does a quick EX shield and then follows up with the damaging version of the bunker 
       (even if you are using half moon style). This does not cost any meter, but degrades guard bar. Has a clash frame on startup.
            </div>
                </div>
                <strong>Counter Hit (CH)</strong>
                <div>
                    When a move hits the opponent while they have a move out during its startup or active frames.
                    Puts the opponent in a longer period of hitstun and untech time than a normal hit, and may even knock them down. 
                    Some moves and actions can be counter hit during recovery too, making them much riskier to use.
                </div>
                <strong>Dodge and Air-Dodge</strong>
                <div>
                    2E or 2A+B causes the character to shine and become invincible for a short time. 
                    However, it has recovery, so it is not possible to dodge every attack. A dodge weakens the guard bar, 
                    so it shouldn't be overly relied upon for defense.
                Some characters' ground dodges are actually rolls that moves your character toward a direction.
                        This can be used to go behind the opponent.Air dodges have uses outside that of just avoiding the opponent's attack. 
                They can be used to realign your character to face the opponent in air during combos or for cross ups.
                </div>
                <strong>Frame Trap</strong>
                <div> A sequence of moves in which one (usually advantageous on block) attack is used, 
                        followed by a second one that hits as soon as the opponent's hit/block stun ends. 
                        This leaves a very small gap during which if the opponent tries to use a move such as 2A,
                        they will get counter hit during their startup by the frame trap's next attack.
                    This can also be referred to as <b> Stagger Pressure</b> in blockstrings.</div>
            
                 <strong> Another Arc-Drive (AAD) </strong>
                    <div>
         41236C in BLOOD HEAT will activate another, usually stronger, version of the Arc-Drive. 
         Using it will deplete all your remaining Magic Circuit.
                    </div>
<h2>Standard notation</h2>
    <p>
        This is the standard notation for transcribing combos on this wiki. 
            You'll find similar notation conventions in other airdashing fighting games, 
            as it makes combos or complex blockstrings easy to describe and read.</p>

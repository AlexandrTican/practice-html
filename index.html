                                 <li> 
                                      Frame data: Neco-Arc boasts the fastest 2A in the game at 3 frames, 
                                      and her three slowest normals are frames 11, 8, and 6.
                                  </li>
                                <li>  Backdash: It has 16 frames of invincibility with only 5 frames of recovery,
                                    its teleporting nature makes it hard to punish on reaction,
                                     and her already-fast grounded normals can be all canceled into it, making them very safe.
                                    </li>
                                <li> Tiny: Neco-Arc's hitbox  is so small that her opponents 
                                     require unique blockstrings and combos just to prevent her from falling out,
                                     which are both always less optimal than their universal options, 
                                     and require extra effort to learn. 
                                     Combined with the difficulty of switching between the two in a bracket setting, 
                                     it's common for her to slip through the cracks and reverse into her own combo. 
                                    </li>
                            </ul>
                        </td>
                        <td><li>Range of a Rat: Neco-Arc "boasts" some of the worst range in the entire genre, 
                            making it difficult to punish certain moves, or to even approach close enough to start pressing buttons.</li>
                        
                            <li>Limited mobility: Her airdash is designed for air-stalling rather than covering distance, 
                                and her dash startup is relatively slow at 6 frames. 
                                Her great backdash also doesn't help in this regard. 
                                Expect to use 214X liberally against foes who refuse to approach.</li>
